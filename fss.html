                <p>By creating an interactive affinity diagram, we were able to organize common concerns between workgroups and visualize potential solutions. <br>Our team identified and presented where new team-oriented or company-wide  strategies were necessary to meet growth and employee needs.
                New work habits, organizational architecture, and technologies were reccomended based on our research findings.  Implementation also acknowledged where company culture could be maintained and incoorporated.  The following deliverables were presented to shareholders:
                <ul>
                  <li><span class="bold">Organizational Restructuring</span><br> Workgroups with overlapping responsibilities, frequent use of the same folders or creation of duplicate folders, and frequent communication were provided new new cross-comunication & workflow guidelines.</li>

By providing the guidelines for an "Organization Field Day", workgroups were able to adopt uniform practices for onboarding, documentation formatting, organization best practices, workshop stucure, naming conventions, organization checklists, QA protocols, administrator duties.</li>
