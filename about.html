					<h2>Hi! I’m Surita</h2>
					<p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio!<br>
					A little about me: I recently recieved my Masters in Information at the University of Michigan, where my focus was on Human Computer Interaction & User Experience. I currently live in Seattle, where I work remotely as a UX Intern at Evva Health Inc.  I have a passion for technical and educational writing, and I am curious how language can be combined with UX Methodology to improve discoverability, particularly for mobile products. </p>
					<br>
					<h2>My Approach...</h2>
					<p>My background in scientific research and technical education taught me to communicate complex processes with precision and care. In UI, I combine affordances and signifiers with concise language to guide the user. In practice I frequently use information architecture, qualitative analysis, user testing, and surveys to inform my design solutions. <br>
					When I am not working, you can find me at the beach, Trader Joe's, or enjoying the Pacific Northwest's sights.
